# Technical Architecture

Dark Age is built on Unreal Engine 5, leveraging modular C++ and Blueprint systems. The architecture emphasizes scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.

- Modular subsystems for gameplay, UI, and world simulation
- Doxygen-style documentation for all C++ code
- Extensive use of Data Tables and Blueprints for rapid iteration
