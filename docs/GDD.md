## 1. Core Vision & Philosophy

### 1.1. The Elevator Pitch
**Dark Age** is an unforgiving, hyper-realistic medieval survival RPG where you are not a prophesied hero but a common soul fighting for a foothold in a collapsing world. It blends the deep crafting, base-building, and brutal survival of games like *Valheim* and *The Long Dark* with the complex, player-driven systemic depth and emergent narratives of *Kenshi* and *Project Zomboid*.

### 1.2. The Core Pillars
*   **Unforgiving Realism:** Every system is designed to be plausible and challenging. Starvation is a real threat, a broken leg is a crisis, and winter can be a death sentence. There are no magical shortcuts.
*   **Dynamic, Living World:** The world of Aerthos breathes. NPCs have schedules, needs, and goals. Factions wage war, economies react to supply and demand, and ecosystems respond to player actions. The world does not revolve around the player, but it will remember them.
*   **Deep Systemic Emergence:** We don't write stories; we build systems that create them. A bandit attack on a merchant caravan isn't a scripted event; it's the result of a bandit camp's desperation, a caravan's predictable route, and the AI Director recognizing an opportunity.
*   **Meaningful Progression:** Power is not measured in levels alone. True advancement is building a fortified home, mastering the art of steel-making, establishing a lucrative trade route, or earning the trust of a powerful faction. It's about conquering the environment, not just its inhabitants.

### 1.3. Target Audience & Market Positioning
*   **Primary Demographic:** Ages 25-45, fans of hardcore survival, deep CRPGs, and emergent gameplay sandboxes. They crave challenge, complexity, and the freedom to forge their own path. They are patient, methodical, and find satisfaction in overcoming difficult obstacles through planning and skill.
*   **Psychographic Profile:** "The Homesteader," "The Tactician," "The Explorer."
*   **Market Position:** A premium, B2P title on PC (Steam, GOG). It sits at the intersection of Survival, RPG, and Simulation, aiming to be the most detailed and systemic medieval survival game on the market.

### 1.4. The Player Fantasy
The core fantasy is one of **true grit and earned achievement**. It is the fantasy of rising from nothing by one's own wits and will.
*   You are not "The Chosen One." You are a nobody.
*   You are not handed a destiny. You must forge one.
*   You are not all-powerful. You are vulnerable, and your greatest weapon is your mind.
*   Your victories are not pre-ordained. They are hard-won and deeply satisfying.

## 2. The World of Aerthos: A Land in Twilight

![Placeholder for a grim, panoramic painting of Aerthos's landscape](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200.png/111111/808080?text=Concept%3A_The_Bleak_Beauty_of_the_Heartlands)

### 2.1. The Grand History
Aerthos was once the jewel of the Valorian Empire, an empire built on reason, stone, and steel. The Valorians were master engineers and administrators, not sorcerers. They built grand aqueducts, paved roads that connected every corner of the continent, and established a rule of law that brought an unprecedented era of peace and prosperity.

Then came the **Crimson Fading**, a plague that defied all reason. It didn't just kill; it dissolved the very bonds of society. Within a generation, the Empire was a corpse. The great cities fell silent, the roads became the domain of bandits, and the intricate web of trade and governance unraveled.

It has now been 127 years since the fall. The world is a patchwork of isolated settlements, each struggling to hold back the encroaching wilderness and the darkness of human nature.

### 2.2. The State of the World
*   **Technology & Knowledge:** Much has been lost. The formula for Valorian concrete is a mystery. Advanced metallurgy is a forgotten art. Literacy is rare outside of monasteries and the halls of the Merchant Guild.
*   **Law & Order:** Imperial Law is a memory. Justice is local, swift, and often brutal. "Might makes right" is the prevailing ethos in many regions.
*   **The Supernatural:** There is no overt magic. However, the world is filled with superstition. Strange plants with unusual properties, ancient ruins that hum with a forgotten energy, and folk tales of monstrous beasts that lurk in the deep woods. Whether these are truly magical or simply phenomena not yet understood is for the player to discover.

### 2.3. Thematic Tone & Atmosphere
*   **Visuals:** Muted, desaturated color palettes. A "dirty medieval" aesthetic. Light is a precious resource, making torches and lanterns essential. The world should feel vast, ancient, and indifferent.
*   **Audio:** Ambient, minimalist soundscapes. The howl of wind, the distant cry of a wolf, the creak of leather. Music is sparse, used to punctuate moments of tension, discovery, or rare tranquility.
*   **Core Mood:** A constant, low-level tension. A sense of melancholy for a world that was lost, and a fragile hope for one that might be rebuilt.

### 2.4. Detailed World Regions
*   **The Heartlands (Temperate Forest):**
    *   **Description:** The former breadbasket of the Empire. Now, crumbling highways cut through overgrown forests and fields have been reclaimed by nature. Dotted with small, walled farming villages and the ruins of great villas.
    - **Resources:** Abundant wood, stone, fertile soil, common game animals (deer, boar).
    *   **Hazards:** Bandit patrols, wolf packs, rival settlements.
*   **The Iron Peaks (Alpine/Taiga):**
    *   **Description:** Jagged mountains that scrape the sky. Bitterly cold. Home to hardy, insular mining clans and the skeletons of failed Imperial mining operations.
    *   **Resources:** All tiers of ore (copper, tin, iron, coal), rare mountain herbs, goats.
    *   **Hazards:** Extreme cold, blizzards, avalanches, dangerous predators (bears, sabrecats).
*   **The Mirefen (Swamp/Marsh):**
    *   **Description:** A sprawling, humid wetland where the great rivers of the continent meet the sea. Ancient, moss-draped trees, murky waters, and the buzzing of insects are ever-present.
    *   **Resources:** Unique plants for alchemy, rare fish and amphibians, bog iron.
    *   **Hazards:** Pervasive disease, quicksand, venomous creatures (giant snakes, spiders), disorientation.
*   **The Sunken Coast (Coastal/Maritime):**
    *   **Description:** A rugged coastline of towering cliffs, windswept beaches, and salt-scarred fishing villages. The sea is both a source of life and a constant threat.
    *   **Resources:** Salt, fish, seabird eggs, salvageable wreckage.
    *   **Hazards:** Sudden storms, pirate raids, treacherous tides.

### 2.5. Flora & Fauna
Each biome has a unique set of plants and animals that form a simulated ecosystem.
*   **Flora (Example: Rivercress):** Found near rivers. A key ingredient in healing salves. Over-harvesting will make it scarce in that area for a season.
*   **Fauna (Example: Deer):** Grazes in meadows. Hunted for meat, hide, and sinew. If their predator (wolves) is eliminated from a region, the deer population will boom, potentially damaging forests and attracting more predators.

## 3. The Factions of Aerthos

### 3.1. Major Factions

#### **The Merchant Guild**
*   **Ideology:** "Progress through Prosperity." Amoral, pragmatic, and ruthlessly efficient capitalists.
*   **Hierarchy:** Led by the unseen 'Coinmasters.' Regional chapters run by 'Factors'.
*   **Key NPCs:**
    *   **Factor Tiber:** Runs the Millhaven chapter. A portly, pragmatic man who is obsessed with logistics. He is the player's first likely contact.
    *   **Silas "The Ledger" Vorn:** The Guild's ruthless enforcer in the Heartlands. Manages bounty contracts and "hostile asset denial."
*   **Inter-Faction Relationships:**
    *   **Remnant Legion:** A necessary nuisance. The Legion's patrols make trade safer, but their tolls and taxes are a constant source of friction.
    *   **Circle of Hands:** Viewed with suspicion. The Circle hoards knowledge that could be profitable, refusing to share. The Guild actively seeks to acquire their secrets.
*   **Player Interaction & Quest Lines:**
    *   **Early Game:** Escort quests for caravans moving between settlements. Resource procurement contracts (e.g., "Acquire 100 Iron Ore for the Millhaven chapter.").
    *   **Mid Game:** Investment opportunities ("Buy into the Millhaven lumber mill for a share of the profits."). Sabotage quests against rival, non-Guild merchants. Establishing new, high-risk, high-reward trade routes.
    *   **Late Game:** Market manipulation schemes. Funding a proxy war between two baronies to control the victor. Gaining a seat on a regional Factor's council.
*   **Reputation Tiers & Unlocks:**
    *   **Neutral (0):** Standard prices.
    *   **Respected (+25):** 5% discount on bulk goods.
    *   **Valued (+50):** Access to the Guild's private caravan network for fast travel (for a fee). Unlocks investment opportunities.
    *   **Partner (+75):** Access to exotic goods from distant lands. Can take out loans from the Guild.
    *   **Hated (-50):** Refusal to trade, shops are closed to player.
    *   **Marked (-75):** A permanent bounty is placed on the player's head, and assassins will be periodically dispatched.

#### **The Remnant Legion**
*   **Ideology:** "Order Above All." Authoritarian, disciplined, and deeply suspicious of outsiders.
*   **Hierarchy:** Rigid military structure led by a 'Legate' and his 'Centurions.'
*   **Key NPCs:**
    *   **Centurion Valerius:** Commands the garrison at the ruined Fort Valus. A grim, honor-bound soldier who embodies the Legion's ideals.
    *   **Decanus Lyra:** A younger, more pragmatic officer who sees that the Legion's rigid doctrines are failing them. A potential agent for change or mutiny.
*   **Inter-Faction Relationships:**
    *   **Merchant Guild:** Corrupt, but useful. They provide supplies the Legion cannot produce itself.
    *   **Freeholders:** Obstacles to be assimilated or crushed. Their independence is a challenge to the Legion's authority.
*   **Player Interaction & Quest Lines:**
    *   **Early Game:** Clearing out bandit nests that threaten Legion patrols. Retrieving lost Imperial standards from ruins.
    *   **Mid Game:** Sieges on fortified bandit strongholds. "Pacification" of restless villages that refuse Legion rule. Investigating and eliminating perceived threats to the Legion (which may be other factions).
    *   **Late Game:** Leading a Legionary squad. Participating in a full-scale campaign to "reclaim" a region for the Empire. Uncovering and quashing a mutiny within the Legion ranks.
*   **Reputation Tiers & Unlocks:**
    *   **Auxiliary (+25):** Can be hired as a mercenary for Legion operations.
    *   **Trusted (+50):** Free access to Legion fortresses, quartermaster access.
    *   **Oathbound (+75):** Given command of a small squad, can call for backup.
    *   **Outlaw (-50):** Arrest-on-sight warrant.
    *   **Enemy of the Empire (-75):** Hunted by Legionary death squads.

#### **The Circle of Hands**
*   **Ideology:** "Knowledge is the Only True Power." Secretive order preserving lost Valorian knowledge.
*   **Hierarchy:** Decentralized cells led by 'Masters' of specific crafts.
*   **Key NPCs:**
    *   **Master Elara:** The Master Alchemist of the Heartlands chapter, hidden as a simple village herbalist. She is the keeper of the Circle's lore in the region.
    *   **Thorn:** A silent, deadly guardian of the Circle's hidden libraries. Acts as their field agent and troubleshooter.
*   **Inter-Faction Relationships:**
    *   **All other factions:** Viewed as noisy children squabbling over a broken toy. The Circle sees them as short-sighted and dangerous to the preservation of knowledge.
*   **Player Interaction & Quest Lines:**
    *   **Discovery:** Must demonstrate intellect (e.g., independently discover a formula) to receive an invitation.
    *   **Mid Game:** Recovering lost schematics, intellectual sabotage against other factions.
    *   **Late Game:** Rebuilding major Valorian technology, protecting the Grand Archive.
*   **Reputation Tiers & Unlocks:**
    *   **Initiate (+25):** Access to a hidden Circle workshop.
    *   **Adept (+50):** Taught exclusive, high-tier crafting recipes.
    *   **Master (+75):** Entrusted with a key to the Grand Archive, can direct research.
    *   **Ignoramus (-50):** Circle spreads hostile rumors about the player.
    *   **Threat to Knowledge (-75):** Circle funds player's enemies with unique poisons and traps.

### 3.2. Minor Factions & Groups (Expanded)
*   **The Freeholders:** Organized into local militias. Their leaders are typically village elders or respected farmers. They can be a powerful ally if you support their independence.
*   **The Iron Clans:** Each mountain has its own clan with its own traditions and allegiances. The Black-Tusk clan might be hostile, while the Stone-Beard clan might be open to trade.
*   **The Mire-touched:** Not a unified faction, but a collection of isolated, highly territorial communities. Their expertise in poison makes them valuable but incredibly dangerous to approach.
*   **Bandit-Kings:** Each has a unique "brand" of banditry. The 'Red Wolves' are savage berserkers, while the 'Gilded Crows' are more like a medieval mafia, extorting "protection" money.

---

## 4. The Player Character

### 4.1. Character Creation: The Blank Slate
The player begins as a nobody, a refugee with nothing but the clothes on their back. Creation focuses on appearance and a single 'Background' choice.
*   **Backgrounds:** Farmer (+5 Cooking, +5 Construction), Poacher (+5 Archery, +5 Hunting), Scribe (+5 Alchemy, +5 Research Chance), Blacksmith's Apprentice (+5 Smithing, +5 Bludgeoning), etc.

### 4.2. Core Attributes & Derived Stats

| Attribute (1-20) | Governs | Low-Level Gameplay Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strength (STR)** | Melee, Labor | `MeleeBonusDmg = STR * 1.5`. `CarryCapacity = 50 + (STR * 10)`. `StaminaCostReduction (Melee/Labor) = STR * 1%`. |
| **Dexterity (DEX)** | Ranged, Stealth, Speed | `RangedBonusDmg = DEX * 1.2`. `AttackSpeed = BaseSpeed * (1 + DEX * 0.02)`. `NoiseRadius = BaseNoise * (1 - DEX * 0.03)`. |

| **Disease Resist** | 0% | `CON * 2%` | Chance to resist contracting a disease from a given source. |
| **Armor Rating** | 0 | `Sum of all equipped armor pieces` | Provides damage reduction. See Section 8. |

---

## 5. The Skill & Progression Systems

### 5.1. Philosophy: Learning Through Doing
Improvement comes from action. Using a sword increases the "Blades" skill. This creates organic progression tied directly to player activity.

### 5.2. Skill Categories & Trees (Example: Smithing)

| Lvl | Perk Point | Choice A | Choice B |
|:---:|:---:|:---|:---|
| 10 | 1 | **Sturdy Smith:** Crafted tools have 25% more durability. | **Efficient Smith:** 10% chance to recover some charcoal/ore after crafting. |
| 20 | 2 | **Armor Specialist:** You can improve armor 10% more effectively. | **Weapon Specialist:** You can improve weapons 10% more effectively. |
| 30 | 3 | **Master of the Forge:** Can improve items to 'Masterwork' quality. | **Resourceful Smith:** 15% chance to use no ingots when crafting. |
| 40 | 4 | **Folded Steel:** 'Masterwork' weapons gain a small armor penetration bonus. | **Perfect Temper:** 'Masterwork' armor gains a small durability bonus. |
| 50 | 5 | **Legendary Smith:** Unlock the ability to craft unique, named items from rare materials and schematics. | **Economist of War:** Halves the material cost of repairing weapons and armor you have crafted yourself. |

### 5.3. Experience & Leveling: The Slow Ascent (XP Formulas)
*   `XP_Craft = BaseItemValue * (1 + (INT * 0.01))`
*   `XP_Kill = BaseCreatureXP * (1 + (PlayerLevel / CreatureLevel) * -0.1)` (Less XP for killing weaker creatures)
*   `XP_Discover = BaseLocationValue * (1 + (PER * 0.01))`

---

## 6. The Core Gameplay Loop: Narrative Walkthrough

### 6.1. The First Hour: "Awakening"
The player awakens with no memory on the edge of the Mirefen, having washed ashore from a shipwreck.
*   **0-15 Mins:** Tutorialized objectives. Find a sharp stone (basic tool). Cut vines from a tree (crafting material). Combine them to craft a `Crude Stone Axe`.
*   **15-30 Mins:** Needs become critical. The UI highlights the thirst meter. Objective: Find fresh water. The player finds a stagnant pool (risk disease) or a running stream (safer).
*   **30-45 Mins:** Hunger is now critical. Objective: Find food. The player can forage for berries (some are poisonous, requiring Perception to identify) or use their axe to kill a small creature like a rabbit.
*   **45-60 Mins:** Night approaches. Objective: Build a fire. The player uses their axe to gather wood, then crafts a `Basic Fire Kit`. A successful fire provides warmth, light, and the ability to cook the rabbit meat, neutralizing its disease chance and making it more nutritious. The first day is survived.

### 6.2. The First 10 Hours: "Shelter"
*   The player has a basic grasp of survival. The next goal is a secure base.
*   They will gather wood and stone to build a 1x1 hut with a door, a bed, and a storage chest.
*   They will craft a full set of `Crude Leather Armor` and an `Oaken Club` or `Hunting Bow`.
*   They will likely have their first dangerous combat encounter with a wolf or a lone bandit.
*   They will discover the first nearby settlement, e.g., Millhaven, and interact with an NPC, receiving their first informal "quest."

### 6.3. The First Season (Mid-Game): "Prosperity"
*   The player's base is now a small, fortified compound with crafting stations for Smithing, Carpentry, and Alchemy.
*   They are actively engaging with a chosen faction, running quests for them and increasing their reputation.
*   They have moved on to Tier 2 (Iron) gear and are capable of taking on small groups of enemies and exploring dangerous ruins.
*   The gameplay loop shifts from pure survival to expedition planning: stocking up on supplies to venture into a new biome, retrieve rare resources, and return to upgrade their gear and base.

### 6.4. The First Year (End-Game): "Power"
*   The player is now a significant local power. Their base is a small fortress, possibly with hired NPC guards.
*   They are a high-ranking member of their chosen faction, capable of influencing its decisions.
*   They are crafting Tier 3 (Steel) or even unique "Masterwork" gear.
*   The gameplay is no longer about personal survival but about large-scale projects: establishing and defending a major trade route, leading a faction's army to destroy a rival's stronghold, or completing a master-level project for the Circle of Hands that permanently changes a part of the world map.

---

## 7. The Survival Simulation: A Hostile World

### 7.1. The Needs System (Granular)
*   **Hunger/Thirst:** Deplete over time, faster with exertion. Penalties range from slowed stamina regen to health loss at zero.
*   **Sleep:** Lack of sleep causes 'Exhaustion', reducing max stamina and XP gain. Sleeping in a proper bed provides a "Well Rested" bonus.
*   **Temperature:** Being cold increases hunger and risks hypothermia (reduces max health). Being hot increases thirst. Clothing provides insulation.

### 7.2. The Health & Injury System
*   Health does not regenerate automatically.
*   Heavy damage can cause specific, long-lasting injuries that require splints or extended rest to heal.
    *   **Broken Arm:** Cannot use two-handed weapons or shields.
    *   **Broken Leg:** Reduced movement speed, cannot sprint.
    *   **Concussion:** Distorted vision, scrambled map.

### **Table 7.1: Consumable Items (Partial)**
| Item | Hunger | Thirst | Spoil Time (Days) | Disease Chance | Notes |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| Raw Rabbit Meat | +10 | 0 | 1.0 | 40% | Can be cooked. |
| Cooked Rabbit Meat | +25 | 0 | 3.0 | 0% | |
| Red Berries | +5 | +2 | 2.0 | 0% | Safe to eat. |
| Purple Berries | +5 | +2 | 2.0 | 90% | Causes "Gut Rot". |
| Stagnant Water | 0 | +15 | N/A | 25% | Causes "The Shakes". |
| Clean Water | 0 | +30 | N/A | 0% | Boiled or from a pure source. |
| Healing Salve | 0 | 0 | N/A | 0% | Heals 30 HP over 10s. |
| Splint | 0 | 0 | N/A | 0% | Required to begin healing a broken limb. |

---

## 8. The Combat System: Brutal & Deliberate

### 8.1. Combat Philosophy
Combat is stamina-based, weighty, and deadly. Button-mashing is a death sentence. It is a puzzle of positioning, timing, and resource management.

### **8.2. Damage Calculation Formula**
`FinalDamage = (BaseWeaponDamage * (1 + (RelevantAttribute * 0.05))) * BodyPartModifier * (1 - (TargetArmorDR * (1 - WeaponArmorPen)))`
*   `BodyPartModifier`: Head=2.0x, Torso=1.0x, Limbs=0.75x.
*   `TargetArmorDR`: Damage Reduction value on the armor piece (e.g., 0.25 for 25% DR).
*   `WeaponArmorPen`: Armor Penetration value on the weapon (e.g., 0.1 for 10% Pen).

### **Table 8.1: Weapon Statistics (Tier 1)**
| Weapon | Damage | Speed | Stamina (Light/Heavy) | Special Property |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| Crude Stone Axe | 12 | 0.8 | 15 / 25 | Sunder: Reduces enemy armor effectiveness by 10% for 5s. |
| Iron Shortsword | 15 | 1.1 | 12 / 22 | Bleed: Chance to apply a damage-over-time effect. |
| Hunting Bow | 18 | N/A | 5 (draw) | Damage scales with draw time. |
| Oaken Club | 10 | 0.9 | 10 / 20 | Concussive: Higher chance to stagger opponents. |

### 8.3. Stealth System
*   Based on light, sound, and movement speed. A UI indicator shows the player's current visibility/noise level.
*   Successful stealth attacks from behind with appropriate weapons (daggers) deal massive bonus damage.

---

## 9. The Crafting & Construction Systems

### 9.1. Gathering & Resources
*   Resources have tiers (Tier 1: Copper, Tier 2: Iron, Tier 3: Steel). Higher tiers are in more dangerous areas.
*   Some rare resources only appear at certain times or under specific weather conditions.

### 9.2. Crafting
*   Performed at upgradeable Crafting Stations.
*   **Quality System:** Crafting skill influences outcome, with a chance to create "Fine" or "Masterwork" items with bonus stats.
*   **Breakthroughs:** Advanced recipes are not automatically learned. Players must experiment with materials at a Research Bench to discover them.

### 9.3. Construction (Base Building)
*   Modular, socket-based system (foundations, walls, roofs, etc.).
*   **Structural Integrity:** Buildings require proper support (pillars, foundations) or they will collapse.
*   **Defenses:** Players can build walls, gates, and traps to defend their base from raids.

---

## 10. The Economic Simulation

### 10.1. Regional Markets
*   Each major town has its own simulated market. Prices fluctuate based on local supply and demand, which is affected by world events.
*   **Example:** A harsh winter causes a food shortage in the Iron Peaks, increasing the price of grain. This creates a profitable (but dangerous) trade opportunity.

### 10.2. Trade Routes
*   NPC caravans physically travel between towns. These can be raided by bandits (or the player), disrupting supply lines and affecting prices.
*   Players can eventually invest in or run their own caravans.

---

## 11. The AI & NPC Simulation

### 11.1. The AI Director
*   A "storyteller" AI that monitors the world state and generates dynamic events and quests to create conflict and opportunity based on systemic pressures.
*   If a region's wolf population is decimated, the deer population will boom, and the Director may spawn a "cull the herd" quest or a new apex predator.

### 11.2. The 'Day in the Life' System
*   NPCs have schedules, jobs, homes, needs, and relationships.
*   **Example:** A blacksmith whose ore supply is cut off by bandits will stop working, complain at the tavern, and his happiness will drop, possibly leading him to generate a quest to clear the trade route.

---

## 12. The Quest & Narrative System

### 12.1. Philosophy: System-Driven Narrative
*   Quests should feel organic and grounded. Many will not have map markers, requiring players to listen to dialogue and read their journal.

### 12.2. Dynamic Quest Generator
*   The AI Director generates quests based on templates:
    *   **Cull:** "Too many wolves near the village."
    *   **Rescue:** "My brother was captured by bandits."
    *   **Procurement:** "The blacksmith needs 20 iron ore."
    *   **Caravan Guard:** "Protect my goods on the road to Millhaven."

### 12.3. Dialogue & Rumor System
*   A keyword-based system. Players can hear rumors and then ask other NPCs about them.
*   Skill-gated choices: `[Persuasion 50] Lie about your identity.`

---

## 13. UI/UX Design: An Invisible Hand

### 13.1. Core Principles
*   **Immersive & Diegetic:** Minimal HUD. Physical map item, journal item.
*   **Informative but Unobtrusive:** Clear tooltips are essential. Status icons only appear when a need is critical.
*   **Customizable:** Players can toggle most HUD elements.

### 13.2. Detailed Screen Breakdowns
*   **Inventory:** Grid-based, with slots for equipped items and a detailed stats panel.
*   **Map:** Hand-drawn style, fills in as the player explores. Players can add custom markers.
*   **Journal:** Automatically logs conversations and quest objectives. Has a separate section for player-written notes.

## 14. Game Balance & Data

### 14.1. The First 10 Hours
*   The player should feel constantly challenged but have a clear path to stability. By hour 10, they should have a secure, basic base, Tier 1 gear, and have made contact with at least one major faction.

### 14.2. Mid-Game & End-Game Loops
*   **Mid-Game:** Focus shifts to exploration, Tier 2-3 gear, and increasing faction reputation. The loop involves preparing for long expeditions and returning with valuable resources/knowledge.
*   **End-Game:** There is no "end." The loop becomes about large-scale influence: building a trade empire, leading a faction to dominance, or rebuilding a piece of major Valorian technology that permanently alters the game world.

## 15. Art & Audio Direction

### 15.1. Visual Style
*   **Aesthetic:** "Dirty Medieval Realism." Muted, desaturated colors. Inspired by the raw, grounded look of films like *The Witch* and *The Northman*.
*   **Light:** A key visual and gameplay element. The world should be genuinely dark at night and in dungeons, making torches and lanterns essential tools, not just decorations.

### 15.2. Sound Design Philosophy
*   **Focus:** Immersion and information. The player should be able to identify threats by sound before seeing them.
*   **Audio:** Ambient, minimalist soundscapes. The howl of wind, a distant cry of a wolf, the specific crunch of boots on gravel versus snow.
*   **Music:** Sparse and diegetic where possible (a bard in a tavern). The main score is used only to punctuate moments of extreme tension, discovery, or rare tranquility.
