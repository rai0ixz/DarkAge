# UMultiplayerSocialSubsystem (MultiplayerSocialSubsystem.h)

## Purpose
This subsystem is intended to manage all player-to-player social interactions for multiplayer gameplay. This includes systems like parties/groups, friends lists, and cross-player communication.

## Current Status: Placeholder
As of the current version, this subsystem is a **placeholder** for future development. The C++ class exists in the project structure to establish the architectural foundation, but it contains no functional implementation beyond the basic `Initialize` and `Deinitialize` methods.

## Planned Features (Future Development)
- **Party System:** Allow players to form groups, share quest progress, and see party members' status on the UI.
- **Friends List:** Integration with an online service to manage a list of friends.
- **Player-to-Player Trading:** A secure system for players to trade items and currency.
- **Chat & Communication:** Text and potentially voice chat systems.

## API Reference
The current API is minimal and consists only of the standard subsystem lifecycle functions.

- `Initialize(FSubsystemCollectionBase& Collection)`: Initializes the subsystem.
- `Deinitialize()`: Deinitializes the subsystem.

## Integration Points
- When implemented, this system will integrate heavily with the UI (`UIPartyMenu`, `UIChatWindow`), the `UQuestSystem` (for shared quest state), and the `UInventoryComponent` (for trading).
